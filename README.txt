About txFirmata
===============

Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc). The protocol can be implemented in firmware on any microcontroller architecture as well as software on any computer software package (see list of client libraries below).

Firmata is based on the [midi message format](http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midimessages.php) in that commands bytes are 8 bits and data bytes are 7 bits. 

This is an implementation of the Firmata protocol for Twisted.
